# Eat Out to Help Out Scheme participating establishments

This project uses the HMRC Eat Out To Help Out Registration data to produce a map showing participating restaurants.

You can view the [restaurant Map](https://arcg.is/15aOjm0) on the ESRI Arc GIS Online site.

Participating establishments can use the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme to offer a discount to diners and encourage them to eat at their venues.
The data was collected when establishments registered for the scheme. It includes:
- Establishment name
- Address
- Postcode

Data for establishments and franchises with less than 25 locations can be found here:
